- documentation!
- quasiquoter:
     - fix infix operators (pending haskell-src-meta changes)
     - incorporate view patterns into quasiquote (pending TH changes)
- ShapedContainer has "Unwrapped" as a type synonym family. Since its instances
  are bijective, it should be made a data family. This requires flipping
  it around to be the "Wrapped" type since the unwrapped type is already
  defined in hmatrix.
- The safety of "Unknown" is unclear. Simply creating an "Unknown" value is
  completely safe, as is refining one. However, e.g., adding two Unknown values
  is not.
- move Data.Packed.Static.Syntax.parsecToQ to a better place.
